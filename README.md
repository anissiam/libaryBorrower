1.0 Introduction

During this vast development of information and the great need and interests on reading and broadening our horizons of knowledge, there is a specific and urgent need for developing new apps which facilitate the process of borrowing books via internet without losing time , effort or even money in some situations.
As an android developer, I am thinking of developing an application of a library system of a previously existed library.
This app aims at altering the normal process of borrowing into an electronic one. A person can simply download this app and easily search for whatever book I need by brief and simple steps. One can borrow and return any book whenever and wherever he wants through some notifications and user interface (UI).
This app serves two users: the borrower as well as the librarian.

1.2 Process

First activity after registration is the newly displayed books activity.
1.2.1 Borrowing
First, the borrower searches for the intended book in the search label.
The user then chooses one of the three previously mentioned options of search, so book details will appear in book detail activity which includes the details of the position of the book, in which section and even the shelf as well as knowing if the book is available or not.
The borrower can now access all the book and author details.
When pressing the button of borrowing, the app calls OnClick method and the book now is booked for the same borrower whenever he or she wants by defining the number of days by a dialogue.
Finally, the app leads the borrower to an option of extending the period of borrowing by submitting to specific limitations according to the library.
